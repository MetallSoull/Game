Please, I'll write this here again. DON'T BE STRICT ABOUT MY CODE. I HAVE JUST STARTED LEARNING ALL THOSE THINGS.

P.S 
Sprites were made very fast. And It's fourth time I rewrited my code :D

Okay. So, I continue making the game. Made some random generators of different staff in different tiles. Especially on grass - deco, like flowers and plants and random tree generator. Also added on sand tile random generator of cactuses. That's really cool and fun to make stuff like that. I will continue working on this game and continue learning that type of stuff.
