Please, I'll write this here again. DON'T BE STRICT ABOUT MY CODE. I HAVE JUST STARTED LEARNING ALL THOSE THINGS.

P.S 
Sprites were made very fast. And It's fourth time I rewrited my code :D

Okay. So, I continue making the game. Made some random generators of different staff in different tiles. Especially on grass - deco, like flowers and plants, and random tree generator. Also added on sand tile random generator of cactuses. That's really cool and fun to make stuff like that. I will continue working on this game and continue learning that type of stuff.

Stay on track. Tasks now getting pretty tought to make and understand. Basically, I use AI the most, because find those tasks that I exactly want to do in youtube is really hard one. So, what about changes? I made mobs - simple, silly entities with random movement. One problem just kicked my ass off really hard - I needed to made collisions with entities work normally, but after each attempt they kept getting stucked at each other after collision, so, yeah, this was really complicated one. Also, as you can see, changed my player sprites, because slime was really kinda stupid and spontaneous idea to draw. To be honest, just stole from one of the notch's game, called "Minicraft" (I'm also trying to learn something watching his saved streams on youtube). Another one obstacle in my way is school. I need to focus on some subjects, where I have a really big problems, in reason of my absent for almost a two months. So, yeah, keep going, keep learning (sad enough to realise, that the process will be twice as slow).
